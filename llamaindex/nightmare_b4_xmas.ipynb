Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it\\'s entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it\\'s an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the \\'Real World\\', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\" Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film\\'s prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory. Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film\\'s soundtrack.\\nOn the direction of the film, Selick reflected, \"It\\'s as though he [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn\\'t involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like \\'a Tim Burton film\\', which is not so different from my own films.\" When asked about Burton\\'s involvement, Selick claimed, \"I don\\'t want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.\" Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with digital effects and some second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult, because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and pre-production of Ed Wood.The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having \"around four hundred heads\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7508259415626526), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='df9d135a-1d75-495b-98f9-7bd9bb53074c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='db86a242-c200-4ebc-b250-b93eb7248359', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={}, hash='ded676f2fd0e0961384fd0825dec0890c0cc107ca5e32ed7d9c8699835ba4c7a'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='e6d35439-9fb6-403c-93a4-02dd35602650', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='a231e8d77c4b946fffae70c868998c5ac6cd58cdfa8a88e46a97badbe27a640c'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='38cbb6d0-f065-4243-8aeb-abd51663d866', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='e212192d580ac6d450c560ff904f6b78ed44007941ca861cf2131f97c81ecfc4')}, hash='67dde0fd810180b58df7c7882cee1460cd6c527dc8cca39b03b7541787661944', text='Source 2:\\nSally\\'s mouth movements \"were animated through the replacement method.

The film\\'s soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer prologue and an extra epilogue, both narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart.

Four original demo tracks by Elfman were also included. On September 30, 2008, Disney released the cover album Nightmare Revisited, featuring artists such as Amy Lee, Flyleaf, Korn, Rise Against, Plain White T\\'s, The All-American Rejects, and many more.American gothic rock band London After Midnight featured a cover of \"Sally\\'s Song\" on their 1998 album Oddities.\\nLiLi Roquelin performed a French cover of \"Sally\\'s Song\" on her album Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life? in 2010.\\nPentatonix released a cover of \"Making Christmas\" for their 2018 Christmas album Christmas Is Here!.In 2003, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday soundtrack CD was released. Although most of the album\\'s songs are not original ones from the film, one song is a medley of \"Making Christmas\", \"What\\'s This?\", and \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\". Other songs included are original holiday songs changed to incorporate the theme of the film.

Jack Skellington, who is respected by the citizens as the \"Pumpkin King\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations, but he has grown tired of the same annual routine and wants something new (\"Jack\\'s Lament\"). While wandering in the woods the next morning, he encounters several trees containing doors leading to other holiday-themed worlds (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, Independence Day, Valentine\\'s Day, and St. Patrick\\'s Day) and stumbles into a door leading to Christmas Town (\"What\\'s This?\"). Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns home to show his friends and neighbors his findings, but unaware of the idea of Christmas, they compare everything to their ideas of Halloween (\"Town Meeting Song\"). However, they do relate to one Christmas Town character: its ruler, Santa Claus, or \"Sandy Claws\" as Jack mistakenly calls him. Jack sequesters himself in his house to study Christmas further and find a way to rationally explain it (\"Jack\\'s Obsession\"). After his studying and experimentation accomplish nothing, Jack ultimately decides that Christmas should be \"improved\" rather than understood and announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year.\\nJack assigns the residents many Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents (\"Making Christmas\"), and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer. Sally, a feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision of a burning Christmas tree and warns that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her forewarnings and assigns her with making him a Santa Claus suit. He also tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa and bringing him to Halloween Town (\"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\").

      "=== Filming ===\n",
      "Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming. Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\" Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory. Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack.\n",
      "On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, \"It's as though he [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films.\" When asked about Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, \"I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.\" Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with digital effects and some second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult, because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and pre-production of Ed Wood.The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having \"around four hundred heads\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.\n",

      "Source 2:\n",
      "Sally's mouth movements \"were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, […] only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements.\" The stop-motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack.\n",

      "Halloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and beings associated with the holiday (\"This is Halloween\"). Jack Skellington, who is respected by the citizens as the \"Pumpkin King\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations, but he has grown tired of the same annual routine and wants something new (\"Jack's Lament\"). While wandering in the woods the next morning, he encounters several trees containing doors leading to other holiday-themed worlds (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, Independence Day, Valentine's Day, and St. Patrick's Day) and stumbles into a door leading to Christmas Town (\"What's This?\"). Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns home to show his friends and neighbors his findings, but unaware of the idea of Christmas, they compare everything to their ideas of Halloween (\"Town Meeting Song\"). However, they do relate to one Christmas Town character: its ruler, Santa Claus, or \"Sandy Claws\" as Jack mistakenly calls him. Jack sequesters himself in his house to study Christmas further and find a way to rationally explain it (\"Jack's Obsession\"). After his studying and experimentation accomplish nothing, Jack ultimately decides that Christmas should be \"improved\" rather than understood and announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year.\n",
      "Jack assigns the residents many Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents (\"Making Christmas\"), and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer. Sally, a feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision of a burning Christmas tree and warns that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her forewarnings and assigns her with making him a Santa Claus suit. He also tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa and bringing him to Halloween Town (\"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\"). Jack tells Santa he will be handling Christmas in his place this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe. However, against his wishes, they deliver Santa to Jack's long-time rival Oogie Boogie: a bogeyman with a passion for gambling, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake (\"Oogie Boogie's Song\"). After failing to stop Jack from carrying out his plan (\"Sally's Song\"), Sally attempts to rescue Santa, but is captured.\n",
